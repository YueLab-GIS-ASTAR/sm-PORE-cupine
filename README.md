sm-PORE-cupine
============

sm-PORE-cupine ingests Oxford Nanopore's Direct RNA sequencing data to automatically detect synthetic chemical probes used to identify RNA nucleotides that are not paired in a secondary structure fashion. These unstructured bases are biochemically reactive to NAIN3, a SHAPE-derivative that is routinely used in the lab for structure probing. sm-PORE-cupine first uses mappings from both minimap2 and direct signal alignment mapping (subseqDTW) to directly obtain the signal alignment. A previously described outlier-detection algorithm utilizing one-class SVMs, POREcupine, is then used to call these synthetic RNA modifications to obtain a bit-vector read-out. The final output data is presented using a COO sparse matrix format with an accompanying metadata describing the original read identifier, mapping start position and mapped length. sm-PORE-cupine is a pip distributed snakemake pipeline to help process raw upstream data. It is highly recommended for the user to run the pipeline on a high-performance cluster.

Downstream analysis can be found in `analysis/notebooks`. If you would like to run the analysis, you can install the libraries within `analysis/lib/libsigpore` using instructions found [here](#installation)

TL;DR
------
~~~
conda create -n sm-PORE-cupine python=3.9
conda activate sm-PORE-cupine
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YueLab-GIS-ASTAR/sm-PORE-cupine
cd sm-PORE-cupine/sm-PORE-cupine-0.1.0
pip install -e .
cd ..
export CPATH=/apps/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/include:${CPATH}

Installation
------------
### Conda/Python ###
Create a new conda environment. Clone the repository. Enter the directory and perform editable installation using pip. The requirments will automatically download the dependencies using pip.
~~~
conda create -n sm-PORE-cupine python=3.9
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YueLab-GIS-ASTAR/sm-PORE-cupine
cd sm-PORE-cupine/sm-PORE-cupine-0.1.0
pip install -e .
~~~
### Configuration of CUDA Toolkit to user paths and Compilation of cuDTW ###
Example configuration of CUDA LIB paths (specific to A*STAR pluto) before compiling cuDTW.
~~~
export CPATH=/apps/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/include:${CPATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/apps/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PATH=/apps/cuda/bin:${PATH}
cd src/cuDTW
make
~~~
If an nvidia GPU is unavailable or cuDTW doesn't compile successfully, you can default to using the CPU version of subseqDTW by triggering the config parameter `p_cudtw_use: false` (Default is False). However, this is only recommended for small targeted references (<10Kb).
### Configuration of Downstream Analysis Library (libsigpore) ###
Enter the directory and perform editable installation using pip. pip will download and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file 
~~~
cd analysis/lib/libsigpore
conda install -c bioconda viennarna=2.4.18
pip install -e .
~~~

Usage
-----
Local execution
~~~
smPOREcupine run_pipeline -c <config file> -p 16
~~~
Before executing, we can utilize snakemake's dry-run feature to generate the DAG to check whether the sequence of tasks that will be executed is correctly formed
~~~
smPOREcupine run_pipeline -c <config file> -p 16 --dry-run
~~~

To run on a slurm cluster
~~~
smPOREcupine run_pipeline -c <config yaml file> -q slurm -r <config cluster json> -j 4
~~~

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| subset | after a 1st pass mapping by minimap2, original fast5 files will be reordered into first_pass_minimap2 or first_pass_dtw. Reads that fail to be mapped by minimap2 will enter the first_pass_dtw bin |
| preprocess | Read signal traces are segmented into events |
| mapdtw | if p_cudtw_use is true, a round of signal alignment using subseqDTW will be done to rescue and obtain the mappings |
| alignment | Read signal events are signal aligned (re-squiggled) using the mappings | 

Config File
------------
The configuration file describes all the parameters and input folders or files that are required to execute the workflow. If a required file is missing, sigpore will output a snakemake error. Hence, it is recommended to run the workflow using `--dry-run` before executing the whole pipeline.
